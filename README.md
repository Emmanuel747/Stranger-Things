# Stranger-Things

Built a “Consumer-to-Consumer” (C2C) web marketing platform with JS, jQuery, and a closed source community database. After writing a  bulk of the front-end API calls, event handlers and creating skeleton HTML pages, I focused on the styling and user experience. 

Features included: fixed navbar, on-demand minimalistic input-form tool, client-side rendering, and attractive animations.

Asynchronous functions, CRUD API & JSON Web Tokens
